# Protein

***Multi-platform remote procedure call (RPC) system based on Protocol Buffers***

- Implement RPC services and clients for Elixir and Ruby platforms
- Call remote services using unified, simple client API
- Call to services for an immediate response or push non-blocking requests to async services
- Define services via unified, configurable DSL
- Define service input/outputs using the widely acclaimed Google Protocol Buffers format
- Transport your calls via HTTP or AMQP transports

## Getting Started

Add `protein` as a dependency to your project:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:protein, "~> x.x.x"}]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` to fetch it.
